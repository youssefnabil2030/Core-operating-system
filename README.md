# How to make your own operating system

Creating an operating system (OS) from scratch using the C programming language is a complex and extensive project that involves understanding low-level programming, hardware interactions, memory management, and more. While building a full-featured OS is a long-term project, I can provide you with a basic structure and guide you on how to start. Here's an outline of how you might approach building a simple OS in C:

### 1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - **Install a cross-compiler**: You'll need a cross-compiler to write the OS code for a specific platform.
     - **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is commonly used for compiling C code into machine code for an OS.
   - **Install QEMU**: QEMU is a virtual machine emulator that allows you to test your OS in an isolated environment without affecting your real hardware.
   - **Set up a bootloader**: The bootloader loads the operating system into memory. A popular choice is **GRUB** (Grand Unified Bootloader), which helps load your kernel.

### 2. **Create a Bootloader (Optional if Using GRUB)**
   - The bootloader is responsible for loading your OS kernel into memory.
   - It should be written in **Assembly** and should configure the system to jump to the C code (kernel).

### 3. **Create the Kernel**
   The kernel is the core of the operating system. For a simple OS, the kernel will provide basic functionality, such as memory management and hardware communication. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

#### 3.1. **Basic Kernel Structure**
   - **Kernel entry point**: You need to define an entry point for the kernel where the operating system starts. This is usually a function called `kernel_main` or similar.
   - **Hello, World**: Start by printing a message to the screen to ensure that the OS is running.

```c
// kernel.c
void kernel_main() {
    const char *message = "Hello, Operating System!";
    char *video_memory = (char*) 0xB8000;  // Video memory address
    int i = 0;

    // Print the message to screen
    while (message[i] != '\0') {
        video_memory[i * 2] = message[i];       // Character
        video_memory[i * 2 + 1] = 0x07;         // Color (light gray on black)
        i++;
    }

    while (1);  // Infinite loop to prevent the system from shutting down
}
```

#### 3.2. **Memory Management**
   - A simple memory manager can be implemented to allocate memory to processes. This involves using **paging** and **segmentation**.

```c
// Simple memory management placeholder (expand as needed)
void* malloc(size_t size) {
    static unsigned int heap_end = 0x10000; // Static heap pointer
    void* block = (void*) heap_end;
    heap_end += size; // Increase the heap size
    return block;
}
```

#### 3.3. **Interrupts and System Calls**
   - Handle system calls and interrupts to provide essential functionality like input/output (keyboard, mouse) and process management.
   - You can use the **IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)** to set up interrupt handling.

#### 3.4. **Multitasking**
   - Implement **preemptive multitasking** using interrupts (such as the **Timer Interrupt**).
   - You will need to create a **scheduler** to manage processes.

### 4. **Create System Services**
   - Implement basic system calls like **read**, **write**, and **exit**.
   - The user space will interact with the OS through these system calls.

### 5. **Add Filesystem (Optional for Simple OS)**
   - You can implement a basic filesystem for managing files, but for a simple OS, it might not be necessary at first.
   - You can start with a basic **RAM disk** and expand to more advanced filesystems later (like FAT32).

### 6. **Add Input/Output Drivers**
   - Implement keyboard and mouse drivers using the **IRQ (Interrupt Request)** system to handle hardware input.
   - For output, use the VGA text mode for simple text output to the screen.

### 7. **Testing**
   - Use **QEMU** or other virtualization tools to test your OS without worrying about breaking your hardware.
   - If the system works in the virtual machine, you can move it to real hardware.

### 8. **Expand and Improve**
   - Once you have a simple kernel running, you can gradually add features like:
     - A shell or command-line interface (CLI).
     - File systems and network support.
     - GUI support.
     - Advanced memory management (virtual memory, paging, etc.).

|   |-- syscall.c               // System calls
|-- lib/                        // Libraries (e.g., string manipulation)
|-- include/                    // Header files
|-- Makefile                    // Build file for compiling the OS
